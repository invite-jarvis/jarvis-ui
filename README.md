## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Install OpenClaw

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version)

2. Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   npm install -g openclaw
   openclaw wizard
   ```

3. When asked how to authenticate, choose **OAuth** to use your existing Claude.ai subscription (no extra cost!)

4. Start the gateway:
   ```bash
   openclaw gateway
   ```

You're now talking to Claude through OpenClaw.

### Step 2: Set up ClawGPT

Just tell OpenClaw:

> **Set up ClawGPT for me: https://github.com/craihub/clawgpt**

That's it. OpenClaw will handle the rest.

### Manual setup (if you prefer)

<details>
<summary>Click to expand manual instructions</summary>

1. [⬇️ Download ClawGPT ZIP](https://github.com/craihub/clawgpt/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

2. Extract to your **home folder** as `clawgpt`:
   - **Mac/Linux:** `~/clawgpt/`
   - **Windows:** `C:\Users\YourName\clawgpt\`

3. Start the web server (in the clawgpt folder):
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   ```

4. Open http://localhost:8080

5. The setup wizard will ask for your token. Ask OpenClaw:
   > *"What's my gateway token?"*

> 💡 **Can't find your home folder?** Ask OpenClaw: *"open my clawgpt folder"*

</details>

---

### For developers

```bash
git clone https://github.com/craihub/clawgpt.git ~/clawgpt
cd ~/clawgpt
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

Click the **Settings** button (gear icon) to configure:

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Gateway URL | OpenClaw WebSocket endpoint | `ws://localhost:18789` |
| Auth Token | Gateway authentication token | (from URL or manual) |
| Session Key | OpenClaw session to use | `main` |
| Dark Mode | Toggle dark/light theme | On |
| Smart Search | AI-generated summaries for search | On |
| Export/Import | Backup and restore all chats | — |

### Auto-Connect (Optional)

For multi-browser or incognito use, create a `config.js` file:

```bash
cp config.example.js config.js
# Edit config.js with your token
```

```javascript
window.CLAWGPT_CONFIG = {
  gatewayUrl: 'ws://localhost:18789',
  authToken: 'your-token-here',
  sessionKey: 'main'
};
```

Any browser opening ClawGPT will auto-connect using this config. The file is gitignored so your token won't be committed.

> ⚠️ **Security**: Only use config.js on localhost. If exposed to a network, anyone can view your token in the source.

## 🔧 How It Works

ClawGPT connects directly to OpenClaw's Gateway WebSocket API:

1. Establishes WebSocket connection to your local gateway
2. Authenticates with your token
3. Sends messages via `chat.send`
4. Receives streaming responses via `chat` events
5. Stores chat history in browser IndexedDB (with localStorage fallback)

**No server needed** — It's pure client-side JavaScript.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**Can't find the clawgpt folder?**
- Ask OpenClaw: *"open my clawgpt folder"* — it'll open the folder for you
- Default location: `~/clawgpt/` (home folder)

**Can't connect?**
- Make sure OpenClaw gateway is running (`openclaw gateway status`)
- Check the Gateway URL (default port is 18789)
- Verify your auth token — ask OpenClaw: *"what's my gateway token?"*

**Messages not sending?**
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Status should show "Connected" (green)

**Chat history missing?**
- Chats are stored in browser IndexedDB (per browser/profile)
- Use Settings → Export to back up your chats
- Use Settings → Import to restore from backup

**Moving to a new browser?**
1. In old browser: Settings → Export Chats
2. In new browser: Settings → Import Chats
