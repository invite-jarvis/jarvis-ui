## 🔒 Security

### Local Mode
When running on the same network as your computer, ClawGPT connects directly to your local OpenClaw gateway. Your data never leaves your network.

### Remote Access (Relay Mode)
Need to use ClawGPT from your phone when you're away from home? Enable Relay Mode for secure remote access.

| Security Feature | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **End-to-End Encryption** | XSalsa20-Poly1305 — your messages are encrypted before leaving your device |
| **Zero-Knowledge Relay** | The relay server only sees encrypted blobs, never your actual messages |
| **Perfect Forward Secrecy** | New encryption keys generated for each session |
| **Visual Verification** | Matching words on both devices confirms no man-in-the-middle |
| **No Token Exposure** | Your auth token is never sent through the relay |
| **Chat History Sync** | Your chats sync automatically between desktop and phone |

**Crypto details:** X25519 key exchange, XSalsa20-Poly1305 authenticated encryption, powered by [TweetNaCl.js](https://tweetnacl.js.org/).

> Don't trust our relay? [Self-host your own](https://github.com/craihub/clawgpt-relay) — it's just a simple Node.js server.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Install OpenClaw

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version)

2. Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   npm install -g openclaw
   openclaw wizard
   ```

3. When asked how to authenticate, choose **OAuth** to use your existing Claude.ai subscription (no extra cost!)

4. Start the gateway:
   ```bash
   openclaw gateway
   ```

You're now talking to Claude through OpenClaw.

---

### Step 2: Set up ClawGPT

Just tell OpenClaw:

> **Set up ClawGPT for me: https://github.com/craihub/clawgpt**

That's it. OpenClaw will handle the rest.

---

### Manual setup (if you prefer)

<details>
<summary>Click to expand manual instructions</summary>

1. [Download ClawGPT ZIP](https://github.com/craihub/clawgpt/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

2. Extract to your **home folder** as `clawgpt`:
   - **Mac/Linux:** `~/clawgpt/`
   - **Windows:** `C:\Users\YourName\clawgpt\`

3. Allow ClawGPT to connect to your gateway:
   ```bash
   openclaw config set gateway.controlUi.allowedOrigins '["http://localhost:8080"]'
   ```

4. Start the web server (in the clawgpt folder):
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   ```

5. Open http://localhost:8080

6. The setup wizard will ask for your token. Ask OpenClaw:
   > *"What's my gateway token?"*

> **Can't find your home folder?** Ask OpenClaw: *"open my clawgpt folder"*

</details>

---

### For developers

```bash
git clone https://github.com/craihub/clawgpt.git ~/clawgpt
cd ~/clawgpt
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

## 🌐 Cloud Deployment (Vercel)

Want to access Jarvis UI from anywhere? Deploy to Vercel for free!

### Deploy from Your Repository

**Option 1: Using Vercel CLI (Recommended)**

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy from your project directory
cd ~/jarvis-ui
vercel

# Follow the prompts - Vercel will auto-detect it's a static site
```

**Option 2: Using Vercel Dashboard**

1. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
2. Click "Import Git Repository"
3. Select your GitHub repository (`invite-jarvis/jarvis-ui`)
4. Click "Deploy" (all defaults should work)

Your app will be live at `https://jarvis-ui-<random>.vercel.app`

### Setup After Deployment

1. **Configure CORS** - Allow your Vercel domain:
   ```bash
   openclaw config set gateway.controlUi.allowedOrigins '["https://your-app.vercel.app"]'
   openclaw gateway restart
   ```

2. **Connect via Relay**:
   - On desktop: Open ClawGPT locally → Settings → Enable "Remote Access" → Show QR
   - On phone: Visit your Vercel URL → Scan QR code
   - Verify matching security words appear on both devices

### How It Works

The cloud deployment uses **Relay Mode** exclusively:
- ✅ End-to-end encrypted connection (X25519 + XSalsa20-Poly1305)
- ✅ Works from any network
- ✅ Zero-knowledge relay server (can't see your messages)
- ✅ Visual security verification
- ✅ No cloud storage of your data

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed instructions, troubleshooting, and architecture details.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Click the **Settings** button (gear icon) to configure:

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Gateway URL | OpenClaw WebSocket endpoint | `ws://localhost:18789` |
| Auth Token | Gateway authentication token | (from URL or manual) |
| Session Key | OpenClaw session to use | `main` |
| Dark Mode | Toggle dark/light theme | On |
| Smart Search | AI-generated summaries for search | On |
| Semantic Search | Find related chats by meaning | Off |
| Show Tokens | Display estimated token count | Off |
| Export/Import | Backup and restore all chats | — |

### Auto-Connect (Optional)

For multi-browser or incognito use, create a `config.js` file:

```bash
cp config.example.js config.js
# Edit config.js with your token
```

```javascript
window.CLAWGPT_CONFIG = {
  gatewayUrl: 'ws://localhost:18789',
  authToken: 'your-token-here',
  sessionKey: 'main'
};
```

Any browser opening ClawGPT will auto-connect using this config. The file is gitignored so your token won't be committed.

> **Security**: Only use config.js on localhost. If exposed to a network, anyone can view your token in the source.

## 🔄 Cross-Device Sync

When you connect your phone via the relay QR code, your chat history syncs automatically:

- **Initial sync**: Phone receives all chats from desktop on connect
- **Real-time sync**: New messages appear on both devices instantly
- **Conflict resolution**: Newer changes win (by timestamp)
- **Offline support**: Each device keeps its own local copy

No cloud storage, no accounts — sync happens directly through the encrypted relay connection while both devices are connected.

## 🧠 Cross-Device Memory

ClawGPT's killer feature: **clawgpt-memory** — a file-based conversation store that syncs across all your devices and is readable by your OpenClaw agent.

### How It Works

                                    └─────────────────┘
```

### Setup

On first run, ClawGPT will ask you to select a folder for `clawgpt-memory`.

**Recommended:** Create a folder called `clawgpt-memory` in your ClawGPT directory:
```
clawgpt/
├── clawgpt-memory/    <- Your synced conversations
│   ├── 2026-02-04.jsonl
│   └── 2026-02-05.jsonl
├── index.html
├── app.js
└── ...
```

You can also set this up later in **Settings**.

### File Format

Messages are stored as JSONL (one JSON object per line):

```json
{"id":"abc-0","chatId":"abc","chatTitle":"Hello","role":"user","content":"Hi!","timestamp":1707012345678}
{"id":"abc-1","chatId":"abc","chatTitle":"Hello","role":"assistant","content":"Hello!","timestamp":1707012346000}
```

### Why This Matters

1. **Your OpenClaw agent can read your history** — Ask "what did we talk about last week?" and your agent can search your ClawGPT conversations
2. **True cross-device sync** — Start a chat on your phone, continue on desktop
3. **Your data, your files** — Plain text files you can backup, search, or process however you want
4. **Works offline** — Syncs when devices reconnect

### For OpenClaw Agents

Add this to your agent's memory search paths to access ClawGPT conversations:
```yaml
memorySearch:
  extraPaths:
    - ~/clawgpt/clawgpt-memory/
```

Now your agent can search across both OpenClaw memory AND your ClawGPT chat history.

## 🔧 How It Works

ClawGPT connects directly to OpenClaw's Gateway WebSocket API:

1. Establishes WebSocket connection to your local gateway
2. Authenticates with your token
3. Sends messages via `chat.send`
4. Receives streaming responses via `chat` events
5. Stores chat history in browser IndexedDB (with localStorage fallback)

**No server needed** — It's pure client-side JavaScript.

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**Can't find the clawgpt folder?**
- Ask OpenClaw: *"open my clawgpt folder"* — it'll open the folder for you
- Default location: `~/clawgpt/` (home folder)

**Can't connect?**
- Make sure OpenClaw gateway is running (`openclaw gateway status`)
- Check the Gateway URL (default port is 18789)
- Verify your auth token — ask OpenClaw: *"what's my gateway token?"*

**Messages not sending?**
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Status should show "Connected" (green)

**Chat history missing?**
- Chats are stored in browser IndexedDB (per browser/profile)
- Use Settings → Export to back up your chats
- Use Settings → Import to restore from backup

**Moving to a new browser?**
1. In old browser: Settings → Export Chats
2. In new browser: Settings → Import Chats

**Mobile not connecting?**
- Install the [ClawGPT Android app](https://github.com/craihub/clawgpt-app) for the best experience
- Alternatively, use **Chrome** on mobile — Brave/Firefox may block local WebSocket connections
- Make sure your phone is on the same WiFi network as your computer
